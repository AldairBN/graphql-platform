Basically, the parser tokenized the string which meant that there was a lot of substrings creating new strings and so on.</p>\n<p>Each time we use the V8 parser to parse a <em>GraphQL</em> request we basically created a lot of objects. Instead of just producing our parsed <em>GraphQL</em> document we have created a lot of garbage for the runtime to clean up.</p>\n<p>With version 9 we wrote the parser from scratch to be allocation free. This means that we only use memory to create our GraphQL document tree but not for the actual parsing.</p>\n<p>In order to do that we are no longer parsing using a string but a <code class=\"language-text\">ReadOnlySpan&lt;byte&gt;</code>. With spans on byte we can basically read the query from a binary stream and produce the GraphQL document without producing string objects. Also, the span allows us to slice the incoming data and create new windows on the underlying memory. So, each time we slice the data, we no longer create new string objects that the GC has to get rid of. All of the GraphQL keywords in a GraphQL document that is being parsed are never transformed to a string representation, but will only be represented to the parser as one byte on which the parser makes a decision on what the parsed token means. Also, comments and descriptions will only become strings if they are consumed saving us from unescaping those and more. On a production GraphQL server we do not have the need to consume comment tokens for instance, so we can just skip over them.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, unescaping strings is now much more efficient since we create the string representation just once, all the escape logic is done on the span. We still have to get a second array on which we insert the escaped data but this second byte array can be rented if to large or in the best of cases be allocated on the stack with stackaloc.</p>\n<p>But again the parser will only escape a string sequence and create an actual string object if needed.</p>\n<p>Moreover, our new parser is now a <code class=\"language-text\">ref struct</code> meaning that all the memory we allocate for the parser state is allocated on the stack.</p>\n<p>We still will keep our old parser around and will update both parsers going forward.</p>\n<p>But we did not stop here. Actually, the GraphQL HTTP request is really bad to be processed efficiently. So, with version 9 we are actually still parsing from a string with our new parser.</p>\n<p><strong>GraphQL Request Example</strong>:</p>\n<div\n              class=\"gatsby-code-button-container\"\n              data-toaster-id=\"7443455870826421000\"\n              data-toaster-class=\"gatsby-code-button-toaster\"\n              data-toaster-text-class=\"gatsby-code-button-toaster-text\"\n              data-toaster-text=\"Copied code example\"\n              data-toaster-duration=\"3500\"\n              onClick=\"copyToClipboard(`{\n  &quot;query&quot;: &quot;...&quot;,\n  &quot;operationName&quot;: &quot;...&quot;,\n  &quot;variables&quot;: { &quot;myVariable&quot;: &quot;someValue&quot;, ... }\n}`, `7443455870826421000`)\"\n            >\n              <div\n                class=\"gatsby-code-button\"\n                data-tooltip=\"Copy\"\n              >\n                <svg class=\"gatsby-code-button-icon\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"none\" d=\"M0 0h24v24H0V0z\"/><path d=\"M16 1H2v16h2V3h12V1zm-1 4l6 6v12H6V5h9zm-1 7h5.5L14 6.5V12z\"/></svg>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"query\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"...\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"operationName\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"...\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"variables\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token property\">\"myVariable\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"someValue\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> ... <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The issue here is that we first have to parse the server request which is JSON and then can use the GraphQL query stored as string in the JSON structure to parse the actual GraphQL query document.</p>\n<p>This means that with version 9 we are around 2 to 3 times faster than any .Net parser implementation.</p>\n<p>But as I said we are <strong>NOT</strong> stopping here, we are working on a new specialized request parser that will integrate the JSON parser with the GraphQL parser. That means that we are able to read the GraphQL request directly from the network stream and parse it without any manifestation to a string object.</p>\n<p>Version 9 will bring the new <code class=\"language-text\">Utf8GraphQLParser</code> and we will follow that up with the <code class=\"language-text\">Utf8GraphQLRequestParser</code> in version 9.1.</p>\n<p>In our experiments we see that this new request parser is about 10 times faster then the GraphQL-DotNet parser combined with Json.Net.</p>\n<p>Also, as a side note the version 9 parser now supports all the GraphQL draft features and represents the most GraphQL spec compliant implementation on the .Net platform.</p>\n<h2 id=\"resolver-compiler\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#resolver-compiler\" aria-label=\"resolver compiler permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 512 512\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><path d=\"M326.612 185.391c59.747 59.809 58.927 155.698.36 214.59-.11.12-.24.25-.36.37l-67.2 67.2c-59.27 59.27-155.699 59.262-214.96 0-59.27-59.26-59.27-155.7 0-214.96l37.106-37.106c9.84-9.84 26.786-3.3 27.294 10.606.648 17.722 3.826 35.527 9.69 52.721 1.986 5.822.567 12.262-3.783 16.612l-13.087 13.087c-28.026 28.026-28.905 73.66-1.155 101.96 28.024 28.579 74.086 28.749 102.325.51l67.2-67.19c28.191-28.191 28.073-73.757 0-101.83-3.701-3.694-7.429-6.564-10.341-8.569a16.037 16.037 0 0 1-6.947-12.606c-.396-10.567 3.348-21.456 11.698-29.806l21.054-21.055c5.521-5.521 14.182-6.199 20.584-1.731a152.482 152.482 0 0 1 20.522 17.197zM467.547 44.449c-59.261-59.262-155.69-59.27-214.96 0l-67.2 67.2c-.12.12-.25.25-.36.37-58.566 58.892-59.387 154.781.36 214.59a152.454 152.454 0 0 0 20.521 17.196c6.402 4.468 15.064 3.789 20.584-1.731l21.054-21.055c8.35-8.35 12.094-19.239 11.698-29.806a16.037 16.037 0 0 0-6.947-12.606c-2.912-2.005-6.64-4.875-10.341-8.569-28.073-28.073-28.191-73.639 0-101.83l67.2-67.19c28.239-28.239 74.3-28.069 102.325.51 27.75 28.3 26.872 73.934-1.155 101.96l-13.087 13.087c-4.35 4.35-5.769 10.79-3.783 16.612 5.864 17.194 9.042 34.999 9.69 52.721.509 13.906 17.454 20.446 27.294 10.606l37.106-37.106c59.271-59.259 59.271-155.699.001-214.959z\"/></svg></a>Resolver Compiler</h2>\n<p>With version 9 we have removed the Roslyn compiler and are now using the expression compiler to compile our resolvers. This change was done since Roslyn caused the server to consume a lot of memory. Most of the memory was consumed by native metadata references and we were not able to solve that memory consumption issue. At Microsoft Build I talked to David Fowler about that and he knew about the issue and recommended that we move to expressions. The downside here is that the resolvers produced by the expression compiler are actually a little bit slower than resolvers compiled with roslyn. This has many reasons I do not want to go in here.</p>\n<p>With version 9.1 we will further optimize the resolver compilation by allowing lazy compilation, this will improve startup performance and memory usage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"execution-engine\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#execution-engine\" aria-label=\"execution engine permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 512 512\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><path d=\"M326.612 185.391c59.747 59.809 58.927 155.698.36 214.59-.11.12-.24.25-.36.37l-67.2 67.2c-59.27 59.27-155.699 59.262-214.96 0-59.27-59.26-59.27-155.7 0-214.96l37.106-37.106c9.84-9.84 26.786-3.3 27.294 10.606.648 17.722 3.826 35.527 9.69 52.721 1.986 5.822.567 12.262-3.783 16.612l-13.087 13.087c-28.026 28.026-28.905 73.66-1.155 101.96 28.024 28.579 74.086 28.749 102.325.51l67.2-67.19c28.191-28.191 28.073-73.757 0-101.83-3.701-3.694-7.429-6.564-10.341-8.569a16.037 16.037 0 0 1-6.947-12.606c-.396-10.567 3.348-21.456 11.698-29.806l21.054-21.055c5.521-5.521 14.182-6.199 20.584-1.731a152.482 152.482 0 0 1 20.522 17.197zM467.547 44.449c-59.261-59.262-155.69-59.27-214.96 0l-67.2 67.2c-.12.12-.25.25-.36.37-58.566 58.892-59.387 154.781.36 214.59a152.454 152.454 0 0 0 20.521 17.196c6.402 4.468 15.064 3.789 20.584-1.731l21.054-21.055c8.35-8.35 12.094-19.239 11.698-29.806a16.037 16.037 0 0 0-6.947-12.606c-2.912-2.005-6.64-4.875-10.341-8.569-28.073-28.073-28.191-73.639 0-101.83l67.2-67.19c28.239-28.239 74.3-28.069 102.325.51 27.75 28.3 26.872 73.934-1.155 101.96l-13.087 13.087c-4.35 4.35-5.769 10.79-3.783 16.612 5.864 17.194 9.042 34.999 9.69 52.721.509 13.906 17.454 20.446 27.294 10.606l37.106-37.106c59.271-59.259 59.271-155.699.001-214.959z\"/></svg></a>Execution Engine</h2>\n<p>We have updated our execution engine to use less memory and execute faster. The new execution engine is at least 2.3 times faster and uses half of the memory GraphQL-DotNet does to execute a query. If you are using schema first we are actually seeing 8.9 times faster executon of queries with Hot Chocolate compared to GraphQL-DotNet.</p>\n<p>GraphQL-DotNet is still faster when validating queries, but this is offset since we are caching validation results. Validation will be one of the things we will work on for version 9.1. So, expect improvements here.</p>\n<p>Also, we are putting a lot of work in our new execution plan feature. With execution plans we are seeing 3 times faster query executions compared to the current Hot Chocolate version 9 preview bits.</p>\n<p>The execution plan feature allows us to pre-analyze the query graph and in many cases optimize the execution of resolvers significantly.

One other area we are working on is the subscription implementation. We will replace the current implementation with one built on top of the Microsoft pipeline API, this is why we are moving again subscription stitching to the next version.</p>\n<p>Stitching is also one area we will start to improve performance-wise once we have the execution plan feature implemented.</p>\n<p>The bottom line here is that if you go with Hot Chocolate you will get the most spec compliant and most performant GraphQL server on the .Net platform.</p>\n<p>Each time a GraphQL spec element hits draft status we will go ahead and implement it with Hot Chocolate, this means that with Hot Chocolate you will always get the latest GraphQL features.</p>\n<p>Also, we are working to have all the benchmarkings ready with GraphQL-Bench. This will make it more transparant what we are testing and will let us more easily assess where we are heading performance wise.</p>","fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"7 min read"}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://chillicream.com","author":"Chilli_Cream"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["1014893094","2890364758","4218812017"]}
